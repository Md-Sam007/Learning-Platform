If you would have included how ChatGPT could be utilized for more coding-related subjects, it would be more beneficial to me personally. But I am aware that this course needs to be more inclusive to appeal to all students.",

Understanding the things which TRULY make me happy helped me identify the tasks that I should be focusing on for achieving long-term happiness. This course is especially for people who aren't satisfied with how they spend their 24 hours in the day, or for some reason have regrets. This course has the golden nuggets for that problem.",
